- **useCallback:** Saves functions, avoiding recreation of functions on each render.
- **useMemo:** Saves computational resources by recalculating values only when needed.
- **React.lazy:** Enables efficient loading of components when they are needed.
- **Component Separation:** Enhances reusability and facilitates easier loading by breaking down components into smaller, manageable pieces.
